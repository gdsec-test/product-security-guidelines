## Core documentation principles

Documentation should be

- Simple
  - It takes time to simplify.  Take the time
- Skim-able
  - Clear headlines and placement of details
  - Detailed but relevant
  - Cross reference different sections instead of repeating information
- Consumer oriented (headers of "How to x" instead of "Documentation of x")

## Documentation guidelines

### Libraries

Libraries should be documented using traditional documentation guidelines, e.g., [godoc] for Golang(https://blog.golang.org/godoc-documenting-go-code) and a README.md with

- Abstract description
- Basic usage (with link to another `.md` for advanced usage / instructions)
- "How it works" and some under the hood implications.
- Any other important information

### Processes

Documentation for processes belong in confluence.
